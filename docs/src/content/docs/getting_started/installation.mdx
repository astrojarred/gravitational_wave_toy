## Installation options

Our package is available on PyPI and can be installed using various methods.

<Aside>
    <p>
        Python 3.11+ is required to create a new project.
        Currently, we recommmend using Python 3.12 for the project
    </p>

### Installing with `uv` (recommended)

`uv` is a tool for managing Python projects and dependencies. It is a modern alternative to `pip` and `venv`, and is lighter and faster than `conda`. For more information, see the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

#### Adding to an existing `uv` project

```bash
uv add gravitational-wave-toy
```

#### Create a new `uv` project

Ininitalize a new project with Python 3.12, then add the gravitational wave toy to the project.

```bash
uv init -p 3.12
uv add gravitational-wave-toy
```

### Installing with `pip`

The gravitational wave toy can be installed into any existing Python environment using pip:

```bash
pip install gravitational-wave-toy
```

### Installing with `conda`

The gravitational wave toy can be installed into any existing conda environment using conda.

1. Make sure `pip` is installed in the environment.
2. Install the gravitational wave toy using pip.

```bash
conda activate my-environment
conda install pip
pip install gravitational-wave-toy
```

## Testing the installation

To test the installation, you can run the following command:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

This will run the test suite and ensure that the installation is working correctly.

In a conda environment or a virtual environment, you can simply run:

```bash
pytest
```
