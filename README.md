## üßê About<a name = "about"></a>

An input GRB model and an instrument sensitivity curve specific to the desired observational conditions are provided as input. Given a delay from the onset of the event, the code uses a simple optimization algorithm to determine at which point in time (if at all) the source would be detectable by an instrument with the given sensitivity.

## üèÅ Getting Started<a name = "getting_started"></a>

You need a gravitational wave event catalog. If you don't have this please contact the maintainers.

In addition, you need a python installation and the packages outlines in `pyproject.toml`. We recommend using `poetry` or `conda` to manage your python environment.

Note: dask is only necessary to read in the output data with the `gwplot` class.

### GW Observations<a name = "instructions-gw-obs"></a>
**Methods:**
This code simulates observations of simulated gravitational wave events to determine under which circumstances the event could be detectable by a gamma-ray observatory. An input GRB model and an instrument sensitivity curve specific to the desired observational conditions are provided as input. Given a delay from the onset of the event, the code uses a simple optimization algorithm to determine at which point in time (if at all) the source would be detectable by an instrument with the given sensitivity.


**Note:** Details regarding the mathematics are provided in `math.md`

**Inputs:**
   - An instrument sensitivity file from `grbsens`
     - Newest version is v3 and can be found [here](CTA_sensitivity/grbsens_output_v3_Sep_2022/)
   - GW event models (currently compatible with O5 simulations)

**Output**
   - a dictionary object containing detection information and parameters of the event itself (extracted from the model)

**Example:**
```python
from gravitational_wave_toy import gwobserve

# import the sensitivity
# interpolation of the sensitivity curve will be done here
sens = gwobserve.Sensitivity(
    "/path/to/sensitivity/file/grbsens-5.0sigma_t1s-t16384s_irf.txt",
    min_energy=0.3,     # generally determined by the energy range of the IRFs
    max_energy=10000,
)

# import a GRB file
# interpolation of the spectra are performed here
grb = GW.GRB("../GammaCatalog_O5/cat05_runID.fits")

# simulate observations
res = grb.observe(
    sensitivity=sens, 
    start_time=3600,     # starting delay in seconds
    target_precision=0.1  # numerical precision 
    )

# output
print(res)

### Plotting Heatmaps<a name = "instructions-plotting"></a>

**Methods:**
This code creates heatmaps from the results of the `gwobserve` method which shows the ideal exposures observation times for different instruments, sensitivities, and subsets of GW events. 

**Inputs:**
   - An output file from `gwobserve` in csv or parquet format
   - Optional: how you would like to filter the data before creating the plots

**Output**
   - heatmaps of the results (either interactive or exported directly as an image)

**Example:**
```python
# import the data
from gravitational_wave_toy import gwplot
gws = gwplot.GWData("/path/to/data/file.parquet")  # or CSV

gws.set_filters(
   ("config", "==", "alpha"),
   ("site", "==", "south"),
   ("ebl", "==", True),
)

ax = gws.plot(
   output_file="heatmap.png",
   title="CTA South, alpha configuration, with EBL",
   min_value=0,
   max_value=1,
)
```

Other important options to `gws.plot` include:
   - `intput_file` (str): The path to the output file.
   - `annotate` (bool): Whether or not to annotate the heatmap.
   - `x_tick_labels` (list): The labels for the x-axis ticks.
   - `y_tick_labels` (list): The labels for the y-axis ticks.
   - `min_value` (float): The minimum value for the color scale.
   - `max_value` (float): The maximum value for the color scale.
   - `color_scheme` (str): The name of the color scheme to use for the heatmap.
   - `color_scale` (str): The type of color scale to use for the heatmap.
   - `as_percent` (bool): Whether or not to display the results as percentages.
   - `filetype` (str): The type of file to save the plot as.
   - `title` (str): The title for the plot.
   - `subtitle` (str): The subtitle for the plot.
   - `n_labels` (int): The number of labels to display on the axes.
   - `show_only` (bool): Whether or not to show the plot instead of saving it.
   - `return_ax` (bool): Whether or not to return the axis object.
