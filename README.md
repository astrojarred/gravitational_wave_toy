## üßê About<a name = "about"></a>

An input GRB model and an instrument sensitivity curve specific to the desired observational conditions are provided as input. Given a delay from the onset of the event, the code uses a simple optimization algorithm to determine at which point in time (if at all) the source would be detectable by an instrument with the given sensitivity.

## üèÅ Getting Started<a name = "getting_started"></a>

You need a gravitational wave event catalog. If you don't have this please contact the maintainers.

In addition, you need a python installation and the packages outlines in `pyproject.toml`. We recommend using `poetry` or `conda` to manage your python environment.

Note: dask is only necessary to read in the output data with the `plot` class.

### GW Observations<a name = "instructions-gw-obs"></a>

#### Methods
This code simulates observations of simulated gravitational wave events to determine under which circumstances the event could be detectable by a gamma-ray observatory. An input GRB model and an instrument sensitivity curve specific to the desired observational conditions are provided as input. Given a delay from the onset of the event, the code uses a simple optimization algorithm to determine at which point in time (if at all) the source would be detectable by an instrument with the given sensitivity.

#### Inputs

- Instrument sensitivity curves
  - This can be calculated using [gammapy](https://gammapy.org/) (recommended) or [ctools](http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools/index.html), via `grbsens`. See the next section for details.
- IRFs. As of v3.0.0 the most recent Alpha configuration IRFs are prod5-v0.1 and can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/5499840#.YUya5WYzbUI).
  - Place files downloaded from Zenodo in a folder with the name of the production (e.g. `prod5-v0.1`) and place all of these folders together in a parent folder (e.g. `CTA-IRFs`).
  ```
  # sample filetree
  CTA-IRFs      (this is the root directory to use with the IRFHouse class)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod5-v0.1
  ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fits
  ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CTA-Performance-prod5-v0.1-North-20deg.FITS.tar.gz
  ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CTA-Performance-prod5-v0.1-South-20deg.FITS.tar.gz
  ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc...
  ‚îÇ¬†¬† prod3b-v2
  ‚îÇ¬†¬† etc...
  ```
- GW event models (currently compatible with O5 simulations).
- EBL files (optional). For CTA these can be downloaded directly with `gammapy` using the `gammapy download datasets` command.
  - These are also automatically [included in the package](/data/ebl/)
  - The environment variable `GAMMAPY_DATA` must be set to the location of the parent folder of `ebl` for this to work.

#### Sensitivity Curves

- Since v3.0, this package can now use gammapy to calculate sensitivity curves. This is the recommended method.
  - Curves will be calculated on an individual basis for each event.
- The old method of using `grbsens` is still supported, but is still supported to compare various methods. An instrument sensitivity file from `grbsens`.

#### Output

- a dictionary object containing detection information and parameters of the event itself (extracted from the model)

#### Example Simulation<a name ="example-simulation"></a>

```python
from astropy import units as u

from gravitational_wave_toy.ctairf import IRFHouse
from gravitational_wave_toy.observe import GRB
from gravitational_wave_toy.sensitivity import SensitivityCtools, SensitivityGammapy

# create a home for all your IRFs
house = IRFHouse(base_directory="./CTA-IRFs")

# load in the desired IRF
irf = house.get_irf(
    site="south",
    configuration="alpha",
    zenith=20,
    duration=1800,
    azimuth="average",
    version="prod5-v0.1",
)

# create a gammapy sensitivity class
min_energy = 30 * u.GeV
max_energy = 10 * u.TeV

sens = SensitivityGammapy(
    irf=irf,
    observatory=f"cta_{irf.site.name}",
    min_energy=min_energy,
    max_energy=max_energy,
    radius=3.0 * u.deg,
)

# load in a GRB and add EBL
grb_filepath = "/path/to/your/grb/cat05_1234.fits".
grb = GRB(file, min_energy=min_energy, max_energy=max_energy, ebl="franceschini")

# load the sensitivity curve for the GRB
sens.get_sensitivity_curve(grb=grb)

# simulate the observation
delay_time = 30 * u.min

res = grb.observe(
    sensitivity=sens,
    start_time=delay_time,
    min_energy=min_energy,
    max_energy=max_energy,
)

print(f"Observation time at delay={delay_time} is {res_ebl['obs_time']} with EBL={res_ebl['ebl_model']}")
# Obs time at delay=1800.0 s is 1292.0 s with EBL=franceschini
```

### Example followup calculation<a name ="example-followup"></a>

```python
import astropy.units as u
import pandas as pd
from gravitational_wave_toy import followup

lookup_talbe = "./O5_gammapy_observations_v4.parquet"

# optional, but it's recommended to load the DataFrame first save time
# otherwise you can directly pass the filepath to the get_exposure method
lookup_df = pd.read_parquet(lookup_talbe)

event_id = 1
delay = 10 * u.s
site = "north"
zenith = 60
ebl = "franceschini"


followup.get_exposure(
    event_id=event_id,
    delay=delay,
    site=site,
    zenith=zenith,
    extrapolation_df=lookup_df,
    ebl=ebl,
)

# returns, e.g.
# {
#     'long': <Quantity 2.623 rad>,
#     'lat': <Quantity 0.186 rad>,
#     'eiso': <Quantity 2.67e+50 erg>,
#     'dist': <Quantity 466000. kpc>,
#     'obs_time': <Quantity 169. s>,
#     'error_message': '',
#     'angle': <Quantity 24.521 deg>,
#     'ebl_model': 'franceschini',
#     'min_energy': <Quantity 0.02 TeV>,
#     'max_energy': <Quantity 10. TeV>,
#     'seen': True,
#     'start_time': <Quantity 10. s>,
#     'end_time': <Quantity 179. s>,
#     'id': 4
# }
```

### Reading Results<a name = "instructions-reading"></a>

Note: The most recent simulations for CTA for the O5 observing run are [available on the CTA XWiki](https://cta.cloud.xwiki.com/xwiki/wiki/phys/view/Transients%20WG/Chasing%20the%20counterpart%20of%20GW%20alerts%20with%20CTA/O5%20Observation%20times%20with%20gw-toy%20package/) for CTA members.

It's very easy to read in the results of the `gwobserve` method when stored in csv or parquet formats. We recommend using `dask` (for very large datasets) or `pandas`. Dask has the same DataFrame functionality but is optimized for large datasets.

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_parquet("/path/to/your/file.parquet")

# filter if you'd like
alpha_config = df[df["config"] == "alpha"]

# convert to pandas
pandas_df = alpha_config.compute()
```

Note: You can also use the `gwplot.GWData` introduced below to access a very easy API for filtering and plotting the data.

### Plotting Heatmaps<a name = "instructions-plotting"></a>

#### Methods
This code creates heatmaps from the results of the `gwobserve` method (stored as csv or parquet files) which shows the ideal exposures observation times for different instruments, sensitivities, and subsets of GW events.

#### Inputs

- An output file containing many observations from `gwobserve` in csv or parquet format
- Optional: how you would like to filter the data before creating the plots

#### Output

- heatmaps of the results (either interactive or exported directly as an image)

#### Example

```python
# import the data
from gravitational_wave_toy import gwplot
gws = gwplot.GWData("/path/to/data/file.parquet")  # or CSV

gws.df  # view the underlying dask dataframe

gws.set_filters(
   ("config", "==", "alpha"),
   ("site", "==", "south"),
   ("ebl", "==", True),
)

# optionally set a list of observation/exposure times to use on the x-axis of the heatmap
# default is 50 log-spaced bins between 10s and 1hr

# gws.set_observation_times([10, 100, 1000, 3600])

ax = gws.plot(
   output_file="heatmap.png",
   title="CTA South, alpha configuration, with EBL",
   min_value=0,
   max_value=1,
)
```

Other important options to `gws.plot` include:

- `intput_file` (str): The path to the output file.
- `annotate` (bool): Whether or not to annotate the heatmap.
- `x_tick_labels` (list): The labels for the x-axis ticks.
- `y_tick_labels` (list): The labels for the y-axis ticks.
- `min_value` (float): The minimum value for the color scale.
- `max_value` (float): The maximum value for the color scale.
- `color_scheme` (str): The name of the color scheme to use for the heatmap.
- `color_scale` (str): The type of color scale to use for the heatmap.
- `as_percent` (bool): Whether or not to display the results as percentages.
- `filetype` (str): The type of file to save the plot as.
- `title` (str): The title for the plot.
- `subtitle` (str): The subtitle for the plot.
- `n_labels` (int): The number of labels to display on the axes.
- `show_only` (bool): Whether or not to show the plot instead of saving it.
- `return_ax` (bool): Whether or not to return the axis object.
